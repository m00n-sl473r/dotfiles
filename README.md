# dotfiles
my dotfiles and such, for easy switching between workspaces


### Listing
emacs
nano
zsh/antigen
gitconfig
irssi
ssh

### TODO:
 - (check) Create a script that checks for differences between the local settings and the repo, backs up the local settings within the repo then attempts a merge.
 - autoenv? something like that maybe
 - gather-files/merge-files/deploy-files etc
 - switch from antigen to something like zplug
 - find a way to speed up the zsh -- SWITCH TO ZPLUG
